TRIAL 1
Hyperparams :
-Goal Probs = 0.6/0.4
-Epochs = 6
-REG_COEFF = 6.0
-MIS_COEFF = 1.0
-BATCH_SIZE = 10
-Train Set Size = 1000 + 1000
Observation :
-Mostly produces [0.52401 0.47599] for both cat and dog samples (biased towards cats)
-Tries to reach same goal state (adds greyish tinge to all pixels except some, which become same for all images)
-Loss Plot P1.png
-Images plot D1_i.png
-Mean Absolute Noise for last batch : 0.016543236
